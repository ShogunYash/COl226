Variable Cannot be decl again with same name
Created let for declaration and normal assignments for updation of value with same type
If var decl then same type will only update it
In loops I should update the env for a that specific loop and remove all the declarations done by the loop, 
plus if iterator was already declared then update the value and dont delete it.
Now keep track of the variables that were present earlier and loop updated it as they should reflect finally in outer part.
Check POWER code
Make the update of i in for correct it
